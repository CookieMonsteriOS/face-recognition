# Face Recognition using Python

This Python script demonstrates how to perform face recognition using the `face_recognition` library. It captures video from your webcam and compares each frame to a known face image to recognize faces in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- face_recognition (`pip install face_recognition`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Replace `"known_face.jpg"` in the script with the path to the image containing the known face you want to recognize.
3. Run the script using `python face_recognition.py`.
4. The script will capture video from your webcam and display recognized faces in real-time.

## Notes

- Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer and the necessary permissions granted for accessing it.
- You can customize the script further to add more known faces or modify the recognition logic.

## Credits

- This script utilizes the `face_recognition` library, developed by Adam Geitgey. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
